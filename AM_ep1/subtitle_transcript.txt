OVERWATCH: Alert, alert, alert, stabilisation
report

ALYX: Well there she is, gassed up and ready
to go.

ELI: are go sure you have everything you
need?

ALYX: I think so.

ELI: Alyx!

ALYX: Dad! Get away!

ELI: Alyx, listen to me.
Destroy that ship, whatever it takes.

ALYX: Dad! Don't!

ALYX: Dad! Look out!

ELI: Close your eyes, honey! Don't look!

ALYX: I love you, dad!

ELI: I love you, sweetheart.

ALYX: Oh my god! No!

ALYX: Dad, oh god dad.

ALYX: Dad, please.

ALYX: *Crying*

ALYX: Oh my god.

ALYX: Don't leave me...

*Civil Protection Radio*

OVERWATCH: Citizen Reminder: a civilized society
demands swift and targeted oversight. Prohibit
fellow citizens from threatening the community.

ELI: Alyx! How's it looking up there?
ALYX: It's good dad. Metrocop movement is
normal.

Same for the Combine patrols. How's it going
in the stockyard?

ELI: One Combine mini reactor from a shipment
of four thousand. They're never gonna miss
it. Here, see for yourself. 
RUSSELL: And not only that, someone's hacked into the Combine construction network.

ALYX: Don't get greedy guys, we're not made
of time here.

RUSSELL: One minute and I'm out, guaranteed.

ALYX: Oh! Also, I spotted the Combine moving
supplies into the quarantine zone. That place
has been deserted for years. 
ELI: Well, that is odd.

Well. Well, we'll look into it when we get
back.

Meet back at the safehouse. *Static*

We'll be there soon.

RUSSELL: What is this?
*Call ends*

ALYX: What is it?
Terrific...

OLGA: Alyx! Are we good?
ALYX: Yep! They got the reactor, easy peasy.

I'm headed back to the safe house right now
to meet dad.

ALYX: Go! We'll be in touch.
OLGA: Stay safe.

OLGA: Alyx! Over here!
ALYX: What is it?

OLGA: This doesn't seem like a routine sweep
are you sure everything went okay?

ALYX: 100%.
OLGA: Something's got the CP's riled up.

ALYX: Keep your head down and be smart.

COMBINE GRUNT 1: Hands up! Don't move!

ALYX: Wait! Wait! I just, I just live here!

COMBINE GRUNT 2: Probably anti-citizen. Get
a scan.

ELI: We didn't steal anything!

COMBINE ORDINAL: We don't care, what did you
see?

ELI: No one! I didn't see anyone!

COMBINE ORDINAL: We'll get it out of him.
Take him to the transporter.

COMBINE CHARGER: What about her?
COMBINE ORDINAL: Her too.

ALYX: Where are you taking me?

Where's my father? Hello?
Damn it! Where's my father!?

METROCOP 1: Tell her to stop moving around
back there.

METROCOP 2: Stop moving!

METROCOP 1: What is that?

Grenade!

VORTIGAUNT: We have been trapped in the dark...

We are ripped from ourselves...

VORTIGAUNT: The Alyx Vance must come...

VORTIGAUNT: We are waiting for you, Alyx Vance...

ELI: Open your eyes, honey. Open your eyes...

DRONE: You. Have. Been. In. An. Accident.
Put. On. The. Headset

RUSSELL: Alyx, you there?  You've got to get moving.

ALYX: Russell?  I've been in an accident.

RUSSELL: I know!  I caused it!  So, technically not an accident.

ALYX: Wait, where's dad?
RUSSELL: He's fine. Follow the drone.

ALYX: So, dad's okay?

RUSSELL: Yeah, well, no. To be honest with
you, he's in huge trouble. They've still got
him. He was in a separate transport.

ALYX: And you saved me?
RUSSELL: Well, yes. I had no way of knowing

who was in which van, so yes, the result was
that I saved you.

ALYX: Do we know where they're taking him?
RUSSELL: Criminal holding. And then when they
realise he's Eli Vance, to Nova Prospekt
But I'm already working on a plan to get him
back.

You're close to my lab! Keep following the
drone.

RUSSELL: Alyx! Everything cut out there for
a second. I lost the headset video feed. Can
you see my drone? Is it okay?

ALYX: Uhh. Sure. Yeah. I'll be there in a
minute.

RUSSELL: Alyx! Great, okay let's. Wait, my
drone's okay, right? ALYX: Nope, it exploded.

I'm fine by the way.
RUSSELL: Right, good, that's the main thing.

ALYX: Russell, they've got dad.

RUSSELL: I know. This. This is bad. They're
gonna find out what he knows, and then, yeah,
they're going to kill him.

RUSSELL: But, the good news is we've got something
they don't

ALYX: Which is?

RUSSELL: my plan to get him back!

ALYX: Great, let's hear it.
RUSSELL: Now, pretty soon they're going to
realize that your dad is not going to talk,
and when that happens he's off to have his
brain sucked out.

Err. Potentially. Uh. Maybe not though. I
mean they could just drill into his...
ALYX: Stop.

RUSSELL: Oh yeah. Still your dad.
Right. Well, what they will do, is take him
by train from here. This is Eli, to Nova Prospekt.

ALYX: And if he gets on that train, that's
it? Right?

RUSSELL: Not necessarily. Grab something
that represents us.

RUSSELL: Okay. that's you.
ALYX: I thought you said us.

RUSSELL: well one of us, me, will have to
stay here for this plan to work.

ALYX: Alright, fair enough.
RUSSELL: Just outside there's a second train that also leads out of City 17, through the Quarantine Zone. Both trains intersect here, at Fairview Junction. You take your train, get there before his train, and hack into the controls. That'll let me take over the system. Train comes to a halt. You deal with the Combine situation. And we get your dad back.

ALYX: Where's the train I'm taking? RUSSELL:
Out the back, through the yard. It's decommissioned, but I think I can hack into its controls.

ALYX: Got it.
RUSSELL: Oh! And get yourself a pair of Russells on the way out!

ALYX: Russels?
RUSSELL: The gloves Alyx! You know! The gravity gloves! I have a few sets through there. You can calibrate them out by the shed.

We can do this Alyx. You got that, didn't
you? That I said we could do it?

Because we're gonna do it!
I'm with you every step of the way.

RUSSELL: Oh! Oh! Wait, I almost forgot.

Alyx! Up here! You're gonna need a gun. Don't
worry, it's unloaded.

*Gunshot*

It's unloaded now! Oh, almost forgot. Guns need ammo.

Here you go.

RUSSELL: alright, here we go. Next stop Fairview
Junction.

And good luck Alyx. Goodbye.

RUSSELL: Obviously, just to let you know, I
am still here though.

ALYX: Yeah Russ, I know.
